> **Statement of origionality:** This project was submitted (05/05/2025) as part requirement for the degree of Mechanical Engineering with Robotics at the University of Sussex, department of Engineering and Design. BlueSense2 units, setup/user manuals, and the code for limited memory warping longest common subsequence (LM-WLCSS) implementation were provided by Dr. Daniel Roggen. Except where indicated in the text, all other parts are my own original work

This project will be organised into 3 key sections:

1. Initial stages
   - Sensor functional tests
   - Sensor axis verification
   - Data alignment

2. Main body of work
   - Data segmentation
   - WLCSS implementation
       - LM-WLCSS code provided with corrections made
       - WLCSS testing and result generation
   - SVM and kNN implementation

3. Misc code
   - Random tests
   - Failed data alignment attempts
   - Failed kinematics attempts
   - Other misc code
