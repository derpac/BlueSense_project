Description:

```This project aims to use wearable sensors to classify shots in the game of badminton. Badminton was chosen as it incorporates aspects of speed and technique with rapid dynamic movements of the hand, wrist, and arm to classify. This will be achieved with the use of two BlueSense2 sensors attached to the arm, these will collect accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer data. A control group of shots will be recorded using the inertial sensors. This data will be used to carry out a kinematic analysis of the arm. The data will additionally be put through a range of classification algorithms, identifying and extracting features indicative of certain badminton shots in order to train a classification system. The data will only be recorded by the project owner, this data acquisition will use just the sensors attached to the body and a camera court side to capture the shots for the sake of syncing the data and assessing the effectiveness of each shot. The data will be stored and used anonymously with reference to the body part used and shot name but not the name of the participant. The data will be run through various classification algorithms on MATALB with the end goal being to create a system that can successfully classify certain shots in the game of badminton and to indetify if/when shots were performed incorrectly with a aim to help in the prevention of sports injury

The data collection is imperative for this project. Participant/s will be asked to carry out a range of badminton shots for classification
