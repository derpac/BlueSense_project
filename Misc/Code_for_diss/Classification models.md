## Classification models

### LM-WLCSS

Using the LM-WLCSS model and templates we can see how the model classifies the shots

I should string all the data into a single data stream and generate templates for each to correctly match this way I can tune for the best results generally... 

### SVM



To use the SVM method the data cannot be fed into the model as a long data stream and thus each shot must me extracted. This is a tedious method but must be done. To do this I will first try using peaks and thresholds to segment the shots. 

starting with short serves using **forearm** data between **53.15 - 234.224**. threshold of **183 or up** and a window size of  **2**





### KNN
