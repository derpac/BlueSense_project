### Breakdown of tasks

- **WLCSS**
- **Bespoke / New algorithm for classification**
- **More advanced kinematic analysis**

___

## Kinematic analysis

To carry out the kinematic analysis I will first take the data that at this time (25/02/2025) is yet to be recorded and use this data to calculate the angles between link lengths of the arm by using the gyroscope data. The data must first be trimmed and aligned the code for that already exists. With the angles change with time the arm can be plotted on a graph with approximate link lengths. This really shouldn't be too hard to do... just need the data

___

## WLCSS

With the new data first try to identify the template using Daniels code for WLCSS and test it by changing weightings and such really not much to do here as the code is already written

---

## Bespoke algorithm

for  this first try to identify if any other algorithms are effective using MATLAB learner app this will be a steep learning curve so please start this as soon as possible. Try to identify what weightings and algorithms work best (give best accuracy)
